## Work Experience

**Lane Medical Library, Stanford University**

Manager, Research and Instruction | June 2019 - Present

* Leads the Lane Library’s Research and Instruction team. This team, which currently includes two other full-time librarians, a part-time librarian, and a part-time graduate student, is responsible for much of the library’s research services, education, and outreach related activities. 
* Actively manages the library’s liaison and instruction programs, including coordinating the development (or refresh) of new services, programs, and classes to best meet the needs of the Stanford Medicine community as well as efforts to systematize and document team processes, procedures, and institutional knowledge.
* Actively contributes to efforts within Lane Library, Stanford University, and the broader academic community related to open science, data sharing, and research reproducibility. This includes leading an Open Science discussion group within Lane Library, taking leadership positions in related university centers and initiatives, and collaborating with other institutional stakeholders including the Office of Research.

Data Services and Visualization Librarian | May 2018 – June 2019

* Collaborated with units throughout Lane Library and Stanford Medicine to develop a data-driven data services program that complements the mission of the Research and Instruction team and connects university stakeholders to data-related tools, resources, and expertise. 
* Actively engaged with researchers and clinicians as part of Lane’s liaison program. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing reference support as part of the literature review service and education and outreach-related support through workshops and one-on-one consultations.
* Participated in ongoing initiatives to systematize library services. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, leading an effort to quantitatively evaluate outstanding data-related needs within Stanford Medicine, designing standardized assessment materials for library classes, and documenting team policies and procedures.

**UC Curation Center, California Digital Library**

Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation | June 2016 – May 2018

* Collaborated with stakeholders throughout the University of California system to promote the management, curation, and preservation of scholarly outputs.
* Led the development of tools for facilitating communication between researchers and research service providers- including a toolkit enabling researchers to assess and advance their data-related practices, a customizable survey designed to characterize scholarly communications and data-related practices in neuroscience, psychology, and other research disciplines, and a series of resources addressing how researchers use, share, and value software and computer code.
* Engaged with the local, national, and international open science, digital curation, and research data management communities through participating in academic meetings, authoring blog posts, contributing to digital curation-related discussion groups, and writing grant proposals to fund efforts related to data management, sensitive data, and researcher education and training.

**Markus Library, Rockefeller University**

Science Informationist | July 2013 – May 2016

* Provided proactive research support services at a world-renowned center for biomedical research and graduate education. 
* Facilitated the development of laboratory data collection, management, and storage protocols, designed and administered individualized reference and research support services to students, faculty, and university administrators, and led seminars on topics related to research data management, reference management, and complying with open access and data sharing mandates. 
* Managed library communications and acted as a liaison between the library and campus research communities. Collaborated with RU’s communication, IT, and research support teams to draft recommendations regarding university-wide research data management, research data storage, and open access policies.

**Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, Stony Brook University**

Graduate Researcher and Research Coordinator | September 2008 – December 2013

* Oversaw collaborative research projects investigating information processing in the human brain. Coordinated the activity of collaborators from a variety of disciplines including neuroscience, clinical and cognitive psychology, physics, and computer science. Supervised a team of research support staff including research assistants, technical personnel, and subject pool managers.
* Communicated project goals, results, and implications to a wide variety of audiences including other research scientists through seminar presentations, conference posters, and journal articles, IRB members and lab personnel through internal presentations and reports, and non-expert audiences through public symposia and abstracts.
* Trained undergraduate research assistants and students on best practices in experimental design, statistical analyses, brain imaging techniques, and research data management.
